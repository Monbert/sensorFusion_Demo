## Introduction
This software can calculate a single and weighted value from your input data which include many sensors values. And the value generated by the algorithm is representative of the correct raw data, which means there are some wrong measures in raw data.

## Pre-Requisites to run the software
Platform compatibility: Mac OS 10.12.6, Linux Ubuntu 18.04, Windows 10<br>
1. GNU packages (make, cmake)<br>
2. gcc compiler<br>


## Installing and running
Step 1 : Download the whole project <br>
Step 2 : cd to this project location in the terminal<br>
Step 3 : clean residual files -- terminal command "make clean"<br>
Step 4 : compile all files -- terminal command "make all"<br>
Step 5 : run the executable file -- terminal command "make run"<br>


## Testing
Here we prepare two set of sensor data to test functions, comparing expected results and actual results to tell the function PASS or FAIL in the part of testing.<br>

Step 1 : cd to this project location in the terminal<br>
Step 2 : clean residual files -- terminal command "make clean"<br>
Step 3 : compile all files used in testing-- terminal command "make test"<br>
Step 4 : run the executable  testing file -- terminal command "make run_test"<br>
Step 5 : input 1 or 2 in terminal, then press enter<br>

## Input
Input is stored in /data/input/inputdata.csv. In order to have different results of output, please change different input values of set of sensor data to compute, then save and name it as data/input/inputdate.csv<br>
Details about format of input was showed in doc/Software_documentation.pdf

## Output
The output is stored and showed in an output folder /data/output/outputdata.xls<br>
Details about format of output was showed in doc/Software_documentation.pdf

## Where to find
Software Design Diagram<br>
Details of Function Implementation<br>
Coding Convention<br>
